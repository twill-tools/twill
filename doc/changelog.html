<p>This version is based on twill 1.8, which was a refactoring
of version 0.9 that used requests and lxml instead of mechanize,
done by Ben Taylor in April 2014.  It also integrates ideas and
code from <a class="reference external" href="http://www.coactivate.org/projects/flunc/">Flunc</a> which was created by Luke Tucker and Robert Marianski
in 2006-2007, and from <a class="reference external" href="https://bitbucket.org/brandizzi/retwill/">ReTwill</a> which was created in April 2012
as a fork from twill 0.9 by Adam Victor Brandizzi.
The following improvements and changes were made in this version:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Larger refactoring, clean-up and modernization efforts to support
Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3 and higher.</li>
<li>The console script has been renamed from 'twill-sh' to just 'twill'.</li>
<li>We assume the default file extension '.twill' for twill scripts now.</li>
<li>Uses <a class="reference external" href="http://lxml.de/">lxml</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python-requests.org/">requests</a> instead of mechanize (like in version 1.8),
but doesn't need cssselect and BeautifulSoup any more (unlike 1.8).</li>
<li>Removed bundled packages which have become unnecessary (mechanize)
or are available in newer versions on PyPI (pyparsing, wsgi_intercept)
or in the standard library (subprocess).</li>
<li>Removed parsing options (use_tidy, use_BeautifulSoup, allow_parse_errors)
which have become insignificant due to the use of lxml.html.</li>
<li>We use py.test instead of nosetests for testing twill now.</li>
<li>Optimized the order of the URLs that are tried out by the twill browser.</li>
<li>Added an option '-d' to dump the last HTML to a file or standard output
and an option '-w' to show the HTML directly in the web browser (this
feature was taken over from Flunc).</li>
<li>Add alias 'rf' for 'runfiles' and made runfiles run directories of
scripts as well. This helps writing test suites for twill scripts.</li>
<li>Add command 'add_cleanup' to unconditionally run cleanup scripts after
the current script finished. This allows resetting the state of the
tested server, so that tests will always re-run on a clean state.
Together with a small init.twill script, this creates a test fixture.
(This idea was taken from Flunc, which supports cleanup scripts for
test suites, although in a somewhat different way.)</li>
<li>Accept non string values in variable substitution (this feature has
been backported from ReTwill).</li>
<li>Support XPath expressions in find/notfind commands (this feature has
been backported from ReTwill).</li>
<li>Make output better controllable by using log levels (this feature has
been backported from ReTwill). See options '-l' and '-o'.</li>
<li>Updated the map of predefined user agent strings.</li>
<li>Support basic authentication with realm again (with_default_realm option
switched off, which was broken in version 1.8).</li>
<li>Server certificates are not verified by default, since they are usually
not valid on test and staging servers.</li>
<li>Improved handling of meta refresh. Circular redirects are detected and
'debug equiv-refresh' is functional again.</li>
<li>Moved the  examples and additional stuff into an 'extras' directory.</li>
<li>Made sure everything (except twill-forks) also works on Windows.</li>
<li>Fixed a lot of smaller and larger bugs and problems.</li>
</ul>
