Developing twill
================

twill is entirely written in Python.  You will need Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3
or higher to use and develop it.

Package tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

twill comes with several unit tests.  They depend on `py.test`_ and
`Quixote`_.  To run them, type 'python setup.py test' in the top level
directory, or simply type 'py.test'. To run an individual test, you
can use the command 'python setup.py test -a tests/test_something.py'
or simply 'py.test tests/test_something.py'.

.. _Quixote: http://quixote.ca/

Developer releases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Developer releases" incorporating all recent significant changes are
made available at http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/twill-latest.tar.gz

You can install them with easy_install by typing ::

   easy_install -f http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/twill-latest.tar.gz

Obtaining twill with darcs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

darcs_ is a distributed version control system that allows users to
maintain their own versions of various programs.  It's a convenient
way for me to make the latest source code available quickly, and
it also is a dandy way to submit patches.

To obtain twill using darcs, install darcs and then type

::

   darcs get http://darcs.idyll.org/~t/projects/twill/

To propose a change to the lead developer, make the changes and
then do a 'send':

::

   darcs record -am "explanation of change"
   darcs send -a

To pull in changes made by the lead developer some time later:

::

   darcs pull

Contributions are welcome & will be duly acknowledged!
