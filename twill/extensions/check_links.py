"""
Extension functions to check all of the links on a page.

Usage:

   check_links [ <pattern> ]

Make sure that all of the HTTP links on the current page can be visited
successfully.  If 'pattern' is given, check only URLs that match that
regular expression.

If option 'check_links.only_collect_bad_links' is on, then all bad
links are silently collected across all calls to check_links.  The
function 'report_bad_links' can then be used to report all of the links,
together with their referring pages.

    Make sure that all of the HTTP links on the current page can be visited
    with an HTTP response 200 (success).  If 'pattern' is given, interpret
    it as a regular expression that link URLs must contain in order to be
    tested, e.g.

        check_links http://.*\.google\.com

    would check only links to google URLs.  Note that because 'follow'
    is used to visit the pages, the referrer URL is properly set on the
    visit.
